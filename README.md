### I've just started working with SQL databases and am currently exploring them in Windows 7, which does not give a lot of free options to work with.

#### Thus, the first way I found to work with SQL DBs is via Python
  * Work with SQL DBs via sqlite3 library
  * Work with Pandas to navigate the DBs as clean tables with visualization
